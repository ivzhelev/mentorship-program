**Data Handling and Libraries – Working with Files and Data**

**Goal:** Introduce data structures relevant to the app (e.g., storing clothing info).
**Topics:**

- Lists, dictionaries, and sets for organizing data.
- File I/O: Reading/writing text files (e.g., CSV for store data).
- Intro to libraries: Import and use `csv`, `json`.
- Basic error handling (try-except).

**Activities:**

- Build a simple database: Create a CSV file with sample Bulgarian clothing items (e.g., dress name, store, price, link to eMAG.bg).
- Write a script to search the CSV by keywords (e.g., find dresses under 100 BGN).

**Resources:**

- Python.org documentation on built-in modules.
- Real Python tutorials on lists/dicts and file handling.
- Practice on LeetCode easy problems (e.g., array manipulation).

**Homework:** Expand the CSV with 10-20 real Bulgarian items (students research via web), and write a search function.
