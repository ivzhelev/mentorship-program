**"Basic web stack (HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JS for interactivity)" in plain HTML file**

1. Locally on your laptop, extend the basic HTML page ("my-first.html" from the previous homework): Add a contact form "Contact Me" with fields for "First Name", "Last Name", "Age", "Email" and "Message" and "Submit" button. When the "Submit" button is clicked, make a validation if the input data is correct and print a message OKAY or NOT OKAY. 

The validation should check:

    - if the "Age" value is between 18 and 100
    - if the "Email" value contains @ and . symbols
    - if the "First Name" and "Last Name" values are less than 20 characters

  Embed a video and an audio related to your site topic (you can use free stock images from Unsplash).

  Upload your latest version of "my-first.html" file to your github account and send the link prior to our next meeting on Friday.
  
  **Optional**: Validate your "my-first.html" file with an online HTML validator.

2. Create a page or a post in your Wordpress site looking the same way as the latest version of your "my-first.html". And send me the link prior to our next meeting on Friday.

3. Style your page with CSS: set a color scheme, center headings, add borders to sections, and make links change color on hover. Optional: Create a separate CSS file and link it to their HTML. Upload your latest version of "my-first.html" file to your github account and send the link prior to our next meeting on Friday.
