1. Build a basic HTML page locally on your laptop ("my-first.html") with a heading with your name, a section about yourself (with paragraphs and an image), a list with your goals for this mentorship program, a table containing your previous IT related knowledge and a footer with a copyright notice. Add at least one link to an external site. Upload your "my-first.html" file to your github account and send the link prior to our next meeting on Friday.
**Optional**: Validate your "my-first.html" file with an online HTML validator.
