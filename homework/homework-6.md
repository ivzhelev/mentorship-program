**HTTP vs HTTPS, SSL/TLS, Certificates & Security for Your First Website**

During creating your first website we didn’t configure SSL ourselves, but it’s there (we saw the Padlock and the Certificate details for **emanuil.bg**). HTTPS is very important especially if the site contains Login forms, 
Contact forms, or Any user data. So our sites (under emanuil.bg domain) are automatically configured with HTTPS/SSL which the hosting company has already done for us.

HTTP = postcard (anyone along the way can read it)
HTTPS = sealed, locked envelope with ID check
In 2026 → ~98%+ of web traffic is encrypted with HTTPS, and modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox) warn strongly or even block pure HTTP sites.

**Golden rule:** “If a site asks for data, it MUST use HTTPS.”

Homework:
1. Visit 3 websites:
    - Check certificate info
    - Who issued it?
2. Find one HTTP-only site
    - What warning appears?

3. Create a new MD file in your github repository and there write down in few sentences and examples about: 
     - What is HTTP?
     - What is HTTPS?
     - What is SSL/TLS?
     - What are the Certificates all about – the identity card of a website. What is an SSL Certificate?

 4. Explain HTTPS to a parent in 3 sentences.
 
 5. Spend some time on enhancing the frontend of your **mentorship*.emanuil.bg** site (e.g. if relevent: choose more appropriate theme in Wordpress, add Gallery (if needed), add menu, think about domain name and whatever else you'd like to do in order to improve your site).
